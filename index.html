        <h2>GLOBAL WARMING By BEN PHIRI</h2>
        <p>Global warming is the rise in Earth's average temperature, primarily caused by human activities that increase heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, leading to significant climate change.</p>
        <p>These changes include more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disrupted ecosystems, threatening life on the planet. The burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial emissions are major sources of these gases, emphasizing the need for strategies to mitigate and adapt to this ongoing crisis.  </p>
